#### -jupyter notebook file

#### -1- reading a text file and plot the freq of occrence of each letter
#### -2- create the Monoalphabetic Cipher technique which maps each letter to another different one
#### -3- use the generated private key to encrypt a file  [article.txt]  the encrypted file is [cipher.txt]
#### -4- plot the frequency of occurence of each letter in [cipher.txt]
#### -5- deduce some information about the private key used  

#### -6- create the Poly Substitution Cipher technique which adds some value to the letter based on the specified key 
#### -7- use the generated private key to encrypt a file  [article.txt]  the encrypted file is [poly_cipher.txt]
#### -8- plot the frequency of occurence of each letter in [poly_cipher.txt]
